# Agent Onboarding

This repo hosts a React application built with Vite. Contributors should follow these guidelines when working with the project.

## Setup

1. Use Node.js 18 or later.
2. Run `npm install` before making changes to ensure dependencies are available.
3. The build command is `npm run build`. **Do not commit** the `dist` folder generated by this command.

## Style Guidelines

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- Prefer **single quotes** for strings and end JavaScript statements with **semicolons**.
- Use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).

## Checks

- If an ESLint configuration is present, run `npm run lint` and resolve any reported issues.
- Always run `npm run build` to verify that the application compiles without errors.

## Commit Messages

- Start with a short summary in the imperative mood, 72 characters or less.
- Follow with an empty line and additional details if necessary.

## Pull Request Notes

When opening a PR, include a brief summary of the changes and list the commands you ran to test them.
